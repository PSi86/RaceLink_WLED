"""The channel table, and the header generated from it.

A channel means something operationally: "channel 4" has to name the same
frequency in the host, in the web flasher and on a node, or devices that agree
they are on channel 4 do not hear each other. The table is vendored rather than
re-derived for that reason, and the C header is generated from it rather than
typed a second time.

These tests hold the two ends together: the header cannot drift from the table,
and the table cannot drift into something the firmware would reject.
